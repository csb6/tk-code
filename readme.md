TK-CODE EDITOR

Tk-Code is a prototype clone of VS Code written in Ruby/Tk. It aims to replicate the cross platform, intuitive nature of VS Code using far less memory. Tk is a UI toolkit that creates native applications using cross-platform code, resulting in a more efficient use of system resources than an application running in a Chromium framework.

Eventually, the program will replicate VS Code's abilities to the point where even VS Code extensions can be added and used unaltered. However, this feature is not yet implemented.

Please remember that this is a prototype application. Use with caution; there may be bugs!!!!

Current features:
-Multi-document editing with tabs

Planned features:
-Code highlighting
-Support for VS Code extensions
-Support for fancy styling/syntax highlighting
